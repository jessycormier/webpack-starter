/* 
    _bootstrap-includer.scss
    
    bootstrap.scss manages the bootstrap includes.

    If we don't use alert from bootstrap lets not include it in our final ouput.

    To get finetune control copy paste contets of 
    `node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss` into this file and comment out 
    lines that do not matter.

    To customize bootstraps default settings, you must create a variable with 
    the same name and include it before boostraps var, util, etc files. This is
    because bootstrap has code that says use X var otherwise default to X.
